# README

The data directory contains two subdirectories, `raw_data` and `tidy_data`.

## `/raw_data`

Contributers submit data by adding it to the `raw_data` directory.

## `/tidy_data`

This directory contains analysis-ready data that has been cleaned using scripts in `~/research-project-template/src/`. It will be published in open formats (CSV) adding general metadata as a `README.md` file. In addition to the human readable README with a description of the data, a codebook will be generated that describes the variables and values, following general metadata standards (e.g. schema.org metadata standards). 

The data will be published for long-term archiving using Zenodo publishing service to generate a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). This in return will be added to the CITATION.CFF file contained in `~/research-project-template/`. Together with the a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) credit is attributed to all contributors.
